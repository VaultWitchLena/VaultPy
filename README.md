# VaultPy

## Prerequisites

This tiny library uses [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) \
To show the archs on screen, we used [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

## Quickstart

This simple library contains one class and a tiny wrapper

### <ins>Pointed Arch</ins>

Objects take the half-width `B`, the height `c` and the radii `r` of the circles used in the pointed arch

### <ins>Rotated Arch</ins>

When in 3D, you might want to rotate your arch around the Z axis. This objects take an additional angle `theta`.

## Examples

The Apse.py code shows a rotated Pointed Arch inside a 3D space.

## Usage

This little code was used for a Minecraft project [Liege1630Map](https://liege1630map.be) (French, Belgian) to simplify contruction.
